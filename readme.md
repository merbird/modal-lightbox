## Prerequisites

## Setup
Download widget from GitHub ...

There are two files in the dist directory that need to be included in your html code. These files are bod-modal.js and modal.min.css. The css file should be included in the HEAD section of the webpage on which you want to display the modal lightbox.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="modal.min.css">
```
The js file should be included towards the bottom on your webpage before the closing <\body> tag.
```
<script src="bod-modal.js"></script>
```
If your webpage does not already include jQuery then this also can be added at the end of the webpage, but above the bod-modal.js file. For example, 
```
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <script src="bod-modal.js"></script>
</body>
```
## Incorporating Modal in Website
In order to use the modal image slideshow on a webpage you need to insert code that identifies a slideshow and sets display characteristics. For example, 
```
      <div class="bod-modal" data-interval="4" data-title="right">
         <div class='bod-expand-icon'>
            <a href="full-image-link.jpg" title="Caption Text to display on slide"><img src="image-to-display-on-webpage.jpg" alt="Alt title"></a>
         </div>
         <div class='bod-expand-icon'>
            <a href="full-image-link.jpg" title="Caption Title"><img src="webpage-image.jpg" alt="Alt title"></a>
         </div>
      </div>
```
### Slideshow Container
The slideshow container is identified by the bod-modal class. Each instance of the bod-modal class identifies a different slideshow.  
#### Autoplay
data-interval identifies the autoplay duration in seconds. If this is set to "0" then the slideshow will not autoplay, "2" would wait 2 seconds between slide etc.
#### Caption Location 
data-title identifies the slide caption location. If this is not specified / missing then no caption will be displayed. 
- "left" - displays in bottom left.
- "right" - displays in bottom right.
- "center" - displays in center.
### Image Container
Each image that is to be displayed in the lightroom slideshow should take the format: 
```
   <div class='bod-expand-icon'>
      <a href="full-image-link.jpg" title="Caption Text to display on slide"><img src="image-to-display-on-webpage.jpg" alt="Alt title"></a>
   </div>
```
#### Expand Icon
The optional bod-expand-icon class triggers the display of the expand icon in the top right corner of the image.

![alt text](/markdown/expand.jpg "Expand Icon")

This icon uses Font Awesome, a copy of which can be found in the dist/fonts directory. If you want to display the expand icon then these fonts must be included in the head of your webpage, for example: 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fonts/font-awesome.min.css">
```
#### Slideshow Image
The href points to the full size image you wish to display in lightbox/slideshow when the user clicks on the image referenced in the img tag. 

#### Title / Caption
The title attribute associated with the a tag defines the caption to be displayed over the slideshow image. 

If the title attribute is not defined, or if the if the data-title attribute (see Slideshow Container)  is not specified then no caption is displayed.
